# JavaScript PlayGround (JSPG)
A simulated console for playing with JavaScript

Side note: this project is based on the [Modern Website Seed (MWS)](https://github.com/cjus/modern-web-seed)

## Setup

First I assume you've installed Git and NodeJS

* Download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Download and install [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/)

JSPG requires that you have [bower](http://bower.io/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) installed:

```shell
$ sudo npm install -g bower 
$ sudo npm install -g gulp
$ sudo npm install -g karma-cli
```
     
In the project folder we need to hydrate the project's required files.

```shell
$ sudo npm install
$ bower install
```

Note: this install can take a several minutes to complete.
